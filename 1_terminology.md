# Terminology
Terms discussed:
- Kernel
- Distribution (also called "distro")
- Boot loader
- Service
- Filesystem
- X window system
- Desktop environment
- Command line & shell

## Kernel
Core of the OS. It controls the hardware and makes hardware interact with software applications, i.e. it is the "glue" between hardware and software applications.

## Distribution
Collection of software programs combined with a Linux kernel to create a Linux-based OS.

## Bootloader
(also spelled as "boot loader", and also called "boot manager" and "bootstrap loader")

A program that boots the OS.

"Booting" is the process of of starting a computer via hardware or firmware. This is needed because upon starting, a computer's CPU has no software loaded (this is necessary for the CPU to function) and some process must load software from memory to the CPU to begin the computer's operations. Note that "rebooting" is the same basic process and means "restarting".

## Service
A program that runs as a background process.

## Filesystem
A method for storing and organising files in the persistent memory.

## X window system
A windowing system (also called "window system") is a software suite (i.e. a collection of related  software applications) that separately manages different parts of a display screen. Hence, it is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) that implements the *WIMP* (windows, icons, menus, pointers) *user-interface paradigm*.

X window system is a windowing system for bitmap systems (wherein a range of data is mapped to a particular set of bits), and it provides the toolkit and protocol to build GUIs on nearly all Linux systems.

## Desktop environment
An interface metaphor is a set of user-interface visuals, actions and procedures that, through the use of metaphorical concepts, inform the user about how to interact with the user interface (UI). For example, the interface metaphor used for filesystems is the "file and folder analogy", which draws on our knowledge of physical files and folders to inform us about how to interact with the filesystems.

A desktop metaphor is an interface metaphor for GUIs. For example, most desktop metaphors treat the monitor as the top of the desk, on which objects such as files and folders can be placed. Furthermore, we have the idea of a "window" to view a document, as well as desk accessories such as notepads and calculators.

A desktop environment (DE) is the implementation of a desktop metaphor, made of a collection of programs that run on top of the OS and share the same GUI framework. It is sometimes described as a "graphical shell". Through its implementation of the desktop metaphor, a desktop environment tries to make user interface intuitive and understandable through concepts similar to those in the physical world, such as buttons, windows, menus, etc.

## Command line & shell
Interface for typing commands on top of the OS. The shell is a command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the OS to perform the necessary commands and tasks.
