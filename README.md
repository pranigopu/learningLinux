# Learning Linux
Linux is a family of operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel (the core part of an OS that handles interaction between hardware and software applications). The Linux kernel was first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

I have decided to delve into Linux for the following reasons:

- Linux OS is an open-source and well-documented, enabling me to get hands-on understanding of the workings of an OS, which will in turn enable me to customise, optimise and expand my own applications to a greater extent
- Due to it being lightweight, stable, secure and high-performing, it is the most widely to manage servers, websites or other network-based applications, including distributed computing
- Knowledge of Linux is a prerequisite of software development and deployment platforms such as Docker, which is itself a prerequisite of software orchestration systems that are used for automating software deployment, scaling and management
