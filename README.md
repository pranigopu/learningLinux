# Learning Linux
## Introduction
Linux is a family of operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel (the core part of an OS that handles interaction between hardware and software applications). The Linux kernel was first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

## Motivation
I have decided to delve into Linux for the following reasons:

- Linux OS is an open-source and well-documented, enabling me to get hands-on understanding of the workings of an OS, which will in turn enable me to customise, optimise and expand my own applications to a greater extent
- Due to it being lightweight, stable, secure and high-performing, it is the most widely to manage servers, websites or other network-based applications, including distributed computing
- Knowledge of Linux is a prerequisite of software development and deployment platforms such as Docker, which is itself a prerequisite of software orchestration systems that are used for automating software deployment, scaling and management

## More about Linux
- Linux borrows from Unix
- Linux accesses services through files or file-like objects
- Linux is a multitasking multi-user system
- A Linux-based OS consists of a Linux kernel and a set of software tools for:
	- File and file-related operations
	- User management
	- Software package management

### Note on Unix
Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking multi-user OS designed for flexibility and adaptability, derived from the original AT&T Unix (*whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others*). It was one of the first OS's to be written in C.
